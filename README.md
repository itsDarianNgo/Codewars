**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Codewars challenge! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code for efficiency and/or readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lessons I've learned, practicing these endless supply of questions, is understanding that I still have a long way to go and have a lot of room for growth. I'm okay with not having the solution to every challenge, as long as I have the mindset to consistently improve.
